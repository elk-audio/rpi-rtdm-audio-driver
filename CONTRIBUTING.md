When writing a bug report, try to be as complete as you can regarding the context:
  * Mention the version of Elk Audio OS that you are testing
  * What is your run-time setup (plugins, buffer size, audio/CV channels, sensors, etc.)
  * (if working on a plugin) what is your build environment
  * Include relevant files that helps understand your issue or, better, to reproduce it
